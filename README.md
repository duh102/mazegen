# mazegen
Simple maze generator implemented in python

Intended mainly for use with either NCR7197 printer (see [associated project](https://github.com/duh102/ncr7197_python)) or an OpenSCAD script that creates a cylindrical maze box (see [associated project](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:695794)).

Of course it's modular enough that you could very easily make a printer or generator for most purposes. Yet another maze generation library!
